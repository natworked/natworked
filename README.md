- 👋 Hi, I’m Matt aka @natworked. I chose my handle name as sort of a mashup of networked, and network address translation (NAT) and that it worked. Haha.
- 👀 I’m interested in Cyber Security, Linux, AWS, Github, Python programming, and electric guitar.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git and GitHub, AWS, and deepening my knowledge of Linux.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning, Cyber Security, Linux, AWS, and Python.
- 📫 You can reach me @natworked on Twitter.
